# ZX-Optimized-Images
Zen Cart plugin for optimizing images

ZX Optimized Images is a free Zen Cart plugin for optimizing images. This plugin will automatically optimize your images, resize it to various dimensions and run it through resmush.it to provide the best possible optimization.

Product images are usually the weak spot when it comes to page load time. If you have large high quality images, one single image can easily be 200-500 kB. Product listing pages can easily get to a few MBs because of the images which means it's slower to load.

This plugin will automatically resize your images to the sizes needed by your site, and will then run each of the resized image through one of the most popular image optimization services available.

Once the images are optimized, all optimized variants are saved to your server and are being loaded automatically based on the size needed. You can easily save several megabytes of data transfer when using optimized images. And, of course, the site will load significantly faster.

Let's not forget search engines will love it!
